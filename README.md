# Music-Website

<h1>Music Website</h1>
<hr>
<p>This repository houses the code for a site in which groups - in this case musical groups - 
can post events and gigs they have upcoming. I am trying to build it without a backend and just change everything in the html, which I know is not best practice, but works for something of this scale.</p>
